-learned the TDD approach to programming
-learned the importance of using pure functions within tests and how that can improve the modularity,easy of refactoring, and reduce bugs within code.
-learned how to use mock functions and spyons.
-I specifially used spy ons to determine whether the outgoing messages from my classes were sending the correct data
-got a better undetstanding of what modules to test, how to test them
